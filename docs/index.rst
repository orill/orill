The ORILL Code
==================================================

ORILL is a 1D transmutation, fuel depletion, and radiological protection code useful for nuclear research reactors design and operation.
ORILL has been cooked at the Nuclear Safety Unit of the `Institut Laue Langevin (ILL) <http://www.ill.eu>`_, Grenoble, France.
Actually, there is a need for such a pocket tool, which is not addressed by available heavy codes (FISPACT, CINDER, SERPENT, ORIGEN, VESTA, MURE,...).
