ORILL Code
==========

`ORILL Code <http://orill.readthedocs.io/>`_ is a 1D transmutation, fuel depletion (burn-up) and radiological protection code useful for nuclear research reactors design and operational safety.
ORILL has been cooked at the **Nuclear Safety Unit** of the `Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) <http://www.ill.eu>`_, Grenoble, France.

Actually, there is a need for such a pocket tool, which is not addressed by available heavy codes (FISPACT, CINDER, SERPENT, ORIGEN, VESTA, MURE).

The name “ORILL” comes from “ILL” and
the prefix “OR” is a tribute to the excellent `ORIP_XXI <https://github.com/orill/orip_xxi>`_
freeware from *E.G.Romanov, V.A.Tarasov, F.Z.Vahetov,
Research Institute of Atomic Reactors, Dimitrovgrad, Russia.*
