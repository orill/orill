Based on neutron flux at each time period, ORILL Code compute:

- nuclides inventory after irradiation (Atom, Becquerel, Gram)
- fission rate and power (Fission/s, Watt)
- decay power (Alpha, Beta, Gamma) (Watt)
- effective dose per inhalation (Sv)
- effective dose rate (decay and prompt gammas) at 1 m distance (mSv/h)
- gamma spectrum (decay) with `MicroShieldÂ®V5 <http://radiationsoftware.com/>`_ formatted input file for
  further shielding studies

ORILL Code compute sets of nuclides and/or elements. Elements are automatically converted
into nuclides according `IUPAC <https://iupac.org/>`_ natural abundance.
