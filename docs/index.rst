`ORILL <http://orill.readthedocs.io/>`_ is a code suite for nuclear research reactors design and operational safety.

- ORILLCODE: 1D transmutation, fuel depletion, and radiological protection
- MULTILLABY: multi-compartment model dispersion and transmutation
- HARMATTILL: atmospheric plume dispersion and radiological consequences

ORILL has been cooked at the **Nuclear Safety Unit** of the `Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) <http://www.ill.eu>`_, Grenoble, France.

Actually, there is a need for such pocket tools that not addressed by available heavy codes.

The name “ORILL” comes from “ILL” and
the prefix “OR” is a tribute to the excellent `ORIP_XXI <https://github.com/roeug/ORIP_XXI>`__
