Flux: [1.0e+14, 1.0e+14, 1.0e+14]
# 3-points flux [0.0253 eV, fission average (2 Mev), 14.0 MeV] (neutron/cm2/s)
# Fuel depletion: 3-points flux values, adjust the flux multiplier in "Periods:" to adequate Fission Power
# Transmutation with cold neutrons only: adjust thermal flux with wavelength(cold)/wavelenght(T) factor:
# Flux = [adjusted_thermal_flux, 0.0, 0.0]

Nuclides:
 Al: 1.0
 U-235: 0.1
# Valide nuclides names are: 'U','PU239','94Pu238','PU-240','Bi-194m','BI194M2','83-BI-194m2',...
# Names are not case sensitive, metastable states are m = m1, m2, m3
# Elements like 'U','Al','Ni' are converted into isotopes (according natural abundance mass fraction)

Mass: 100.0
# Mass (total, grams) used only if Unit = 'w'
Unit: 'w'
# Unit for nuclides set: mass fraction('w'), grams('g'), mol('mol'), atoms('atm'), becquerels('bq')

Periods: [['P_1', [3600], 1.0, 'BDF'], ['P_2', [1.0e+3,1.0e+4,1.0e+5], 0.0, 'DIAG']]

# [['ID', [Duration(s),...], Flux multiplyer, Method],...]
# The ID is used to identifiy output files, time in seconds
# Possible computation methods are: 'MMPA', 'BDF' or 'DIAG'
Depth: 8
# Computation depth into chains, 6 to 12 recommanded (more depth = more nuclides = more computation time)

Compute: ['DHEAT','FISPWR','GAMMAS','DOSE','PROMPTG']
# Decay heat('DHEAT'), fission power('FISPWR'), gamma spectrum('GAMMAS'), dose('DOSE'), prompt gammas('PROMPTG')
# Gamma spectrum output: .MX5 file for MicroShield V5 with energies according ICRP74 bins (MeV):
# [0.01,0.015,0.02,0.03,0.04,0.05,0.06,0.07,0.08,0.1,0.15,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.8,1.0,2.0,4.0,6.0,8.0,10.0]
# With 'PROMPTG' option, the gamma spectrum is calculated with decay and prompt gammas
# With 'DOSE' option, inhalation dose (Sv) is calculated according ICRP72 and EAF2010 (adult, public)
# With 'DOSE' option, gamma H10 values (mSv.m2/h) (1m distance) are calculated according ICRP74
