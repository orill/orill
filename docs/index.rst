==========
ORILL Code
==========

ORILL Code is a 1D transmutation, fuel depletion, and radiological protection code useful for nuclear research reactors design and operational safety.
ORILL has been cooked at the **Nuclear Safety Unit** of the `Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) <http://www.ill.eu>`_, Grenoble, France.

Actually, there is a need for such a pocket tool, which is not addressed by available heavy codes (FISPACT, CINDER, SERPENT, ORIGEN, VESTA, MURE).

The name “ORILL” comes from “ILL” and
the prefix “OR” is a tribute to the excellent `ORIP_XXI <http://www.oecd-nea.org/tools/abstract/detail/nea-1880/>`_
freeware from *E.G.Romanov, V.A.Tarasov, F.Z.Vahetov,
Research Institute of Atomic Reactors, Dimitrovgrad, Russia.*
