===========================================

Purpose
-------

ORILL Code is a 1D transmutation, fuel depletion (burn-up), and radiological protection code useful for nuclear research reactors design and operational safety. ORILL has been cooked at the **Nuclear Safety Unit** of the `Institut Laue Langevin (ILL) <http://www.ill.eu>`_, Grenoble, France. 

General Features
----------------

:Small: Code and nuclear data are small (only 4 Mo).
:Fast: Vectorization and parallelization associated with Scipy is transparently available.
:User friendly: ORILL is designed to address practical questions about isotopes inventories, decay heat, dose rate, photons spectrum. It is usable by everyone for 1D point-flux calculation at the speed of light.

Prerequisites
-------------
ORILL needs only Python 2.7 or later, with `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_, `Scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_ and standard modules installed (re, io, yaml, time). Python is available on all platforms (WinPhyton, MiniConda, Debian/Ubuntu).


Installation
------------

Uncompress ORILL files in a directory where a Python 2.7+ shell is available (with Numpy and Scipy). In the Python shell, type:

>>> from ORILL import ORILL_CODE
>>> ORILL_CODE('ORILL_TEST.yml')

The command input file 'ORILL_TEST.yml' located in (/input) subdirectory is processed and the corresponding output files are created in (/output) subdirectory. Have a look at ORILL_TEST.yml file to understand the file syntax. It is recommended to edit this file with `Notepad++ <https://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`_ with the `YAML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`_ markup language.
