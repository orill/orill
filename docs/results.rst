Based on neutron flux at each time period, ORILL Code compute:

- nuclides inventory after irradiation (Atom, Becquerel, Gram)
- fission rate and power (Fission/s, Watt)
- decay power (Nucleon, Electron, Photon) (Watt)
- effective dose per inhalation (Sv)
- decay effective gamma dose rate (mSv/h.cm2)
- gamma spectrum (decay and `PGAA <https://www-nds.iaea.org/pgaa/>`_) with `MicroShieldÂ®V5 <http://radiationsoftware.com/>`_ formatted input file for
  further shielding studies

ORILL Code compute sets of nuclides and/or elements. Elements are automatically converted
into nuclides according `IUPAC <https://iupac.org/>`_ natural abundance.
