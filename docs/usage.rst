Usage
=====

Uncompress ORILL files in a directory where a Python 2.7+ shell is available (with Numpy and Scipy). In the Python shell, type:

>>> import ORILL
>>> ORILL(input='ORILL.yml')

The command input file 'ORILL.yml' located in (/input) subdirectory is processed and the corresponding output files are created in (/output) subdirectory.

:Syntax: Have a look at 'ORILL.yml' file to understand the file syntax. It is recommended to edit this file with `Medit <http://https://packages.debian.org/medit>`_ or `Notepad++ <https://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`_ with the `YAML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`_ markup language.
